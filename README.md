# UI Build Instructions

To generate the appropriate UI files, run the following commands:

## 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Build distribution files

```bash
npm run dist
```

This will generate all necessary UI resources in the ```dist``` directory.

## 3. Content of the ```dist/resources``` directory
The ```dist/resources``` directory contains:
- assets/fonts files
- css/sequra-core.css file
- js files
- lang files

## 4. Rebuilding After Changes

The contents of the `dist` directory are automatically regenerated and committed to the repository on every push to any branch. This is handled by a GitHub Actions workflow, which runs `npm run dist` and commits any changes to `dist` back to the remote repository. You do not need to manually build or commit the `dist` directory when pushing changes; this process is fully automated.

That said, if you want to manually trigger a rebuild of the `dist` directory after every change to the UI source files, the next command should be run:

```bash
npm run dist
```

to regenerate the output files.

## 5. Distributing UI Resources

Once the UI resources are generated in the ```dist``` directory, the new code should be pushed.

In every SeQura integration, should be added a development dependency to the ```sequra-core-admin-fe``` package:

```"sequra-core-admin-fe": "github:sequra/integration-core-ui"```

After adding the dependency, install or update the project's packages using the appropriate package manager (npm) to ensure that ```sequra-core-admin-fe``` is installed.
The package will be placed in the ```node_modules``` directory.

Each SeQura integration includes specific instructions in its README file that should be followed to correctly import and place the CORE UI resources.
